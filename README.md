# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project uses machine learning to detect credit card fraud through unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). It compares model performance using metrics like accuracy and error rates, and includes visualizations for deeper insights.
To run the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, first, ensure that you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. The project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithms. These models are applied to a dataset called creditcard.csv, which you need to download and place in the root directory of the project folder.

You can obtain the dataset from a reliable source such as Kaggle. Once the dataset is ready, navigate to the project folder in your terminal. Install the required libraries by using pip to install packages such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data processing, model building, and visualization. If there's a requirements.txt file provided in the repository, simply use pip install -r requirements.txt to install everything at once.

After setting up the environment, run the code either through a Python script or a Jupyter notebook. If you're using Jupyter, launch it by typing jupyter notebook in your terminal and open the notebook file. Execute the cells to train the models, compare their performance using metrics like accuracy and error rates, and view the generated visualizations.

If the creditcard.csv file is larger than 100 MB, consider using Git LFS to handle large files effectively. Once set up, you can push the project to GitHub without encountering issues related to file size limits.
